A terrible iOS app decryption tool for jailbroken devices.

This is my clone/ripoff of John Coates's [FlexDecrypt](https://github.com/JohnCoates/flexdecrypt), which, unlike most other dumping tools, uses `mremap_encrypted`, and doesn't need to run the app to decrypt it. (see [John Coates's writeup](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/decrypting-apps-ios-john-coates/)).

You probably want to use the real FlexDecrypt or one of the other decryption tools instead of this - I only made this as an exercise in reinventing the wheel.
